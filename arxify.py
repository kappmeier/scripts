r""" Combines a tex file hierarchy into a single document file for arXiv.

The root tex file is read and all files included using '\input' tex commands are
inserted recursively.

During the process, all comments are stripped in a way that lines ending with
comments continue to end with '%'. Comment only lines are completely removed.
The source code is cleaned such that it does not contain consecutive blank
lines.

Usage: arxify.py base_dir root_doc out_file

Example: The call

    $ ./arxify.py ./doc/ document.tex ./doc/document-arxiv.tex

    converts the document contained in document.tex in the subfolder doc/ into a
    single document called document-arxiv.tex in the same subfolder.
