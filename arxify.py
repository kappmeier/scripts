""" Combines a tex file hierarchy into a single document file for arXiv.

The root tex file is read and all files included using '\input' tex commands are inserted recursively.

During the process, all comments are stripped in a way that lines ending with comments continue to
end with '%'. Comment only lines are completely removed. The source code is cleaned such that it does
not contain consecutive blank lines.

Usage: arxify.py base_dir root_doc out_file

Example: The call

    $ ./arxify.py ./doc/ document.tex ./doc/document-arxiv.tex
    
    converts the document contained in document.tex in the subfolder doc/ into a single document called
    document-arxiv.tex in the same subfolder.
